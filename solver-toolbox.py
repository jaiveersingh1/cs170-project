    Write your algorithm here.
    Input:
        list_of_locations: A list of locations such that node i of the graph corresponds to name at index i of the list
        list_of_homes: A list of homes
        starting_car_location: The name of the starting location for the car
        adjacency_matrix: The adjacency matrix from the input file
    Output:
        A cost of how expensive the current solution is
        A list of locations representing the car path
        A dictionary mapping drop-off location to a list of homes of TAs that got off at that particular location
        NOTE: both outputs should be in terms of indices not the names of the locations themselves
